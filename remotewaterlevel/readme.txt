The probe and tankcover are 3D printed with PETG.
Glue the 2 probe parts with super glue together.
The sensor tips are M3 stainless steel bolds. Use a M3 thread tap to make the threads in the probe.
The probe is filled with epoxy resin and I also coated the probe and the tankplug with epoxy resin to make it water tight.
